<h2>Overview</h2>
</a>
For this assignment you will write a name analyzer
for <em>Little</em> programs represented as abstract-syntax trees.
Your main task will be to write <em>name analysis</em>
methods for the nodes of the AST.
In addition you will need to:
<OL>
  <LI> Modify the <tt>Sym</tt> class from program 1 (by including some
       new fields and methods and/or by defining some subclasses).
  <LI> Modify the <tt>IdNode</tt> class in <em>ast.java</em> (by including
       a new <tt>Sym</tt> field, and by modifying its <tt>unparse</tt> method).
  <LI> Write a new main program, <em>P4.java</em> (an extension of
       <em>P3.java</em>).
  <LI> Modify the <tt>Errors</tt> class.
  <LI> Update the <em>Makefile</em> used for program 3 to include any
       new rules needed for program 4.
  <LI> Write two test inputs: <em>nameErrors.Little</em> and <em>test.Little</em>
       to test your new code.
</OL>
<p>
Code for you to use can be found in <em>~cs536-1/public/PROG4.</em>
The files are:

<a name="name analysis">
<h2>Name Analysis</h2>
</a>
<p>
The name analyzer will perform the following tasks:
<OL>
  <LI> <b>Build symbol tables.</b>
       You will use the "list of hashtables" approach (using the
       <tt>SymTab</tt> class from program 1).
  <LI> <b>Find multiply declared names, uses of undeclared names,
       and bad declarations.</b>
       Like C, the Little language allows the same name to be declared
       in non-overlapping or nested scopes.
       The formal parameters of a function
       are considered to be in the same scope as the function body.
       All names must be declared before they are used.
       A <em>bad</em> declaration is a declaration of anything other
       than a function to be of type <tt>void</tt>.
  <LI> <b>Add <tt>IdNode</tt> links</b>:
       For each <tt>IdNode</tt> in the abstract-syntax tree that
       represents a use of a name (not a declaration)
       add a "link" to the corresponding symbol-table entry.
       (As stated above, you will need to modify the <tt>IdNode</tt>
       class in <em>ast.java</em> to have a new field of type <tt>Sym</tt>.
       That is the field that your name analyzer will fill in with
       a link to the <tt>Sym</tt> returned by the symbol table's
       <tt>globalLookup</tt> method.)
</OL>
<p>
You must implement your name analyzer by writing appropriate methods
for the different subclasses of <tt>ASTnode</tt>.
Exactly what methods you write is up to you (as long as they do name
analysis as specified).
<P>
It may help to
start by writing the name analysis method for <tt>ProgramNode</tt>,
then work "top down", adding a method for <tt>DeclListNode</tt>
(the child of a <tt>ProgramNode</tt>), then for each kind of
<tt>DeclNode</tt>, and so on.
Be sure to think about which nodes' methods need to add a new hashtable
to the symbol table (i.e., when is a new scope being entered), and
which methods need to remove a hashtable from the symbol table
(i.e., when is a scope being exited).
<P>
Some of the methods will process the declarations in the program (checking
for bad declarations, and checking
whether the names are multiply declared, and if not, adding appropriate
symbol-table entries), and some will process the statements in the program
(checking that every name used in a statement has been declared, and
adding links).
Note that you should not add a link for an <tt>IdNode</tt> that represents
a use of an undeclared name.
<p>
Your name analyzer should find all of the errors described
in the table given below;
it should report the specified position of the error,
and it should give <em>exactly</em> the specified error message
(each message should appear on a single line, rather than how it is
formatted in the following table).
Error messages should have the same format as in the scanner and parser
(i.e., they should be issued using a call to <tt>Errors.fatal</tt>).
<P>
If a declaration is both "bad" (a non-function declared void)
and is a declaration of a name that has already been declared
in the same scope, you should give <em>two</em> error
messages (first the "bad" declaration error, then the
"multiply declared" error).
<P>
<a name="errorMsgs">

  <TD>
    <CENTER>Type of Error</CENTER>

  </TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
<p>
Note that the names themselves should <em>not</em> be printed as
part of the error messages.

<P>
During name analysis, if a function name is multiply declared
you <em>should</em> still process the formals and the body of the function;
don't add a new entry to the current symbol table for the function,
but do add a new
hashtable to the front of the SymTab's list for the names declared in
the body (i.e., the parameters and other local variables of the function).
<P>
If you find a bad variable declaration (a variable of type <tt>void</tt>),
give an error message and add nothing to the symbol table.

<p>
<a name="other">
<h2>Other Tasks</h2>
</a>
<p>
<a name="class symbol">
<h3>Extending the <tt>Sym</tt> Class</h3>
</a>
It is up to you how you store information in each symbol-table
entry (each <tt>Sym</tt>).
To implement the changes to the unparser described below you will need
to know each name's type.
For function names, this includes the return type and the number of
parameters and their types.
</UL>
You can modify the <tt>Sym</tt> class by adding
some new fields (e.g., a <em>type</em> field)
and/or by declaring some subclasses (e.g.,
a subclass for functions that has extra fields for the
return type and the list of parameter types).
You will probably also want to add new methods that return the values
of the new fields, and it may be helpful to change the <tt>toString</tt>
method so that you can print the contents of a <tt>Sym</tt> for
debugging purposes.
<p>
<a name="idnode">
<h3>Modifying the <tt>IdNode</tt> Class</h3>
</a>
Two changes to the <tt>IdNode</tt> class are needed:
<OL>
  <LI> Adding a new field of type <tt>Sym</tt> (to link the node with the
       corresponding symbol-table entry), and
  <P><LI> Changing the unparse method so that every use of an ID has
       its type (in parentheses) after its name.
       (The point of this is to help you to see whether your name
       analyzer is working correctly; i.e., does it correctly match
       each use of a name to the corresponding declaration, and does
       it correctly set the link from the <tt>IdNode</tt> to the
       information in the symbol table.)
       For names of functions, the information should be of
       the form:
       <tt>param1Type, param2Type, ..., paramNType -> returnType</tt>.
       For names of global variables, parameters, and local variables, the
       information should just be <tt>int</tt> or <tt>double</tt>.
       For example, given a program that contains this code:
       <pre>
       int f(int x, double d) { }
       void g() {
         int x;
         double y;
	 y = x;
         f(x+y*2);
	 g();
       }
       </pre> 
       The unparser should print:
       <pre>
       int f(int x, double d) {
       }
       void g() {
         int x;
         double y;
	 y(double) = x(int);
         f(int, double -> int)(x(int)+(y(double)*2));
	 g(->void)();
       }
       </pre> 
</OL>

<p>
<a name="P4">
<h3>P4.java</h3>
</a>
The main program, <em>P4.java</em>, will be similar to <em>P3.java</em>,
except that
<UL>
  <LI> After parsing, if there are no syntax errors, it will call
       the name analyzer.
  <LI> After that, if there are no errors so far (either scanning, parsing, or
       name-analysis errors), it will call the unparser.
</UL>
Calling the name analyzer means calling the
appropriate method of the <tt>ASTnode</tt> that is the root of the
tree built by the parser.

<p>
<a name="error handling">
<h3>Modifying the Errors Class</h3>
</a>
Your compiler should quit after the name analyzer has finished if any
errors have been detected so far (either by the scanner or
the name analyzer).
To accomplish this, you can add a static boolean field to the <tt>Errors</tt>
class that is initialized to <samp>false</samp> and is set
to <samp>true</samp> if the <tt>fatal</tt> method is ever called
(warnings should not change the value of this field).
Your <samp>main</samp> program can check the value of this field
and only call the unparser if it is <samp>false</samp>.

<p>
<a name="makefile">
<h3>Updating the Makefile</h3>
</a>
You will need to update the Makefile you used for program 3
so that typing "make" creates <em>P4.class</em>.

<P>
<a name="testFiles">
<h3>Writing Test Inputs</h3>
</a>
You will need to write two input files to test your code:
<OL>
  <LI> <em>nameErrors.Little</em> should contain code with errors
    detected by the name analyzer.
    This means that it should include bad and multiply declared names
    for all of the different kinds of names, and in all of the
    different places that declarations can appear.
    It should also include uses of undeclared names in all kinds
    of statements and expressions
  <P><LI> <em>test.Little</em> should
    contain code with no errors that exercises all of the name-analysis
    methods that you wrote for the different AST nodes.
    This means that it should include (good) declarations of all of the
    different kinds of names in all of the places that names can be
    declared,
    and it should include (good) uses of names in all kinds
    of statements and expressions.
</OL>
<p>
Note that your <em>nameErrors.Little</em> should cause error
messages to be output, so to know whether your name analyzer
behaves correctly, you will need to know what output to expect.
<p>
As usual, you will be graded in part
on how thoroughly your input files test your code.

<a name="advice">
<h2>Some Advice</h2>
</a>

Here are few words of advice about various issues that come up
in the assignment:
<UL>
  <LI> For this assignment you are free to make any changes you want
       to the code in <em>ast.java</em>.
  <P>
  <LI> The tree-traversal code you wrote to perform unparsing provides
       a good model for the traversal that you need to write to handle
       name analysis.
       However, you might not want to declare the name-analysis
       methods to be abstract methods of class
       <tt>ASTnode</tt> (as we did for <tt>unparse</tt>).
       This is because you will not need those methods for all nodes; e.g.,
       you probably won't want a name-analysis method for the
       <tt>TypeNode</tt> class (or its sub-classes).
       <p>
       However, you will need to declare the name-analysis methods
       to be abstract methods of some of the
       classes that are lower down in the inheritance hierarchy;
       for example, you will need to declare an abstract name-analysis
       method for the <tt>DeclNode</tt> class, because the method for
       the <tt>DeclListNode</tt> class will call that method for each
       node in the list.

  <P>
  <LI> If you are working with a partner, you will have to decide how to
       divide up the work.  
       You might want to divide up some of the "incidental tasks"
       (like modifying the <tt>Errors, Sym</tt>, and <tt>IdNode</tt> classes),
       then work together to get a small part of the name-analysis
       phase working (e.g., finding multiply declared global variables).
       Then you could split up the <tt>ASTnode</tt> subclasses, and each
       implement the name-analysis methods for your
       subset of those classes (you might want to start by choosing just a
       few each, until you have a better idea which ones will require the
       most work).
       <P>
       Don't forget to test your work as you go along, rather than waiting
       until everything is finished!
