<h2>Clarifications and Corrections</h2>
Watch this space for clarifications and corrections!

<a name="introduction">
<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>
For this assignment you will write a code generator for Little programs
that generates MIPS assembly code suitable as input to the Spim interpreter.
The code generator will be implemented by writing <em>codeGen</em>
member functions for the various kinds of AST nodes.
<b>See the on-line Code-Generation notes for lots of useful details.</b>
<P>
You will also update the Makefile and the main program
(and call it <em>P5.java</em>)
so that, if there are no errors (including type errors),
the code generator is called after the type checker.
The code generator should write code to
the file named by the second command-line argument.
<P>
Note that your main program should no longer call the unparser, nor
should it report that the prgram was parsed successfully.
<P>
Our versions of
<A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~cs536-1/PROG5/ast.java"> ast.java</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~cs536-1/PROG5/Sym.java"> Sym.java</A> 
for the previous assignment will be in
<tt>~cs536-1/public/html/PROG5</tt>
You can use this code if there were problems with your own version.
Since we are supplying you with our own typechecking code, we 
recommend that you use our versions above.
<P>
Some useful code-generation methods can be found in the file
<A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~cs536-1/PROG5/Codegen.java">
~cs536-1/public/PROG5/Codegen.java</A>.
Note that to use the methods and constants defined in that file
you will need to prefix the names with <tt>Codegen.</tt>;
for example, you would write: <tt>Codegen.genPop(Godegen.T0, 4)</tt>
rather than <tt>genPop(T0, 4)</tt>.
(Alternatively, you could put the declarations of the methods and
constants in your ASTnode class; then you would not need the
<tt>Codegen</tt> prefix.)
Also note that a PrintWriter <tt>p</tt> is declared as a static
public field in the <tt>Codegen</tt> class.
The code-generation methods in <tt>Codegen</tt>.java all write to
PrintWriter <tt>p</tt>, so you should use it when you open the output file
in your main program (in P5.java);
i.e., you should include:
<tt>Codegen.p = new PrintWriter(args[1]);</tt>
in your main program (or <tt>ASTnode.p</tt> if you put the declarations
in the ASTnode class).
You should also close that PrintWriter at the end of the program:
<tt>Codegen.p.close();</tt>

<a name="spim">
<h2>Spim</h2>
<P>
Documentation on Spim is available on-line:
<UL>
  <LI> <A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~horwitz/spim/spim.pdf">
            Reference Manual (pdf)</A>
  <LI> <A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~larus/spim.html">
            Instructions for download and install (html)</A>
</UL>
You can run "plain"
spim by typing: <tt>spim -file xxx</tt>
where <tt>xxx</tt> is the name of the file produced by your compiler.
Or you can use the X-windows version:
<OL>
  <LI> Type: <tt>xspim</tt>. This will open a new window.
  <LI> Click on the "load" button.
       This will open a small window in which you should type the name of
       the file produced by your compiler;
       finish with a carriage-return, or click on the
       "assembly file" button in the small window.
  <LI> Click on the "run" button. This will open another small window.
       Click on the "ok" button in that window.
</OL>
Syntax and runtime errors will be reported at the bottom of the large
window opened when you first typed <tt>xspim</tt>.
If your Little program produces output, yet another window will be opened,
and the output will be written to that window.
<P>

the corresponding <A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~cs536-1/PROG5/hello.spim">MIPS code</A>
produced by our code generator.

<h2>Changes to Old Code</h2>

Required changes:
<OL>
  <LI> Add to the name analyzer or type checker (your choice), a check
       whether the program contains a function named <tt>main</tt>.
       If there is no such function, print the error message:
       "No main function".
       Use 0,0 as the line and character numbers.
  <P><LI> Add a new "offset" field to the Sym class (or to the appropriate
       subclass(es) of Sym).
       Change the name analyzer to compute offsets for each function's
       parameters and local variables (i.e., where in the function's
       Activation Record they will be stored at runtime) and to fill
       in the new offset field.
       Note that each int variable requires 4 bytes of storage and
       each double variable requires 8 bytes of storage.
       Remember that if the current offset is k when the name
       analyzer processes an int variable declaration, then the
       offset for that variable is k, while if the current offset
       is k when the name analyzer processes a double variable
       declaration, then the offset for that variable is k-4.
       You may find it helpful to verify that you have made this
       change correctly by modifying your unparser to print each local
       variable's offset.
</OL>
Suggested changes:
<OL>
  <LI> Modify the name analyzer to compute and save the total size of the
       local variables declared in each function (e.g., in a new field of the
       function name's symbol-table entry).
       This will be useful when you do code generation for function
       entry (to set the SP correctly).
  <P><LI> Either write a method to compute and return the total size
       of the formal parameters declared in a function, or modify the
       name analyzer to compute and store that value (in the function
       name's symbol-table entry).  This will also be useful for code
       generation for function entry.
</OL>

<a name="optional">
<a name="Little semantics">
<h2>Non-Obvious Semantic Issues</h2>
<OL>
  <LI> All parameters are passed by value.
  <P>
  <LI> In Little conditions (in if statements, while loops, or for loops),
       the value zero means false, and any other value means true.
       So for example, the following code would print "true".
       <UL>
       <pre>
       int x = -2;
       if (x) {
         printf("true");
       }
       </pre>
       </UL>
  <P>
  <LI> The "and" and "or" operators (&& and ||) are short-circuited,
       as they are in Java. 
       That means that their right operands are
       only evaluated if necessary (for all of the other binary operators,
       both operands are always evaluated).  If the left operand of "&&"
       evaluates to <em>false</em>, then the right operand is not evaluated
       (and the value of the whole expression is <em>false</em>);
       similarly, if the left operand of "||" evaluates to <em>true</em>,
       then the right operand is not evaluated (and the value of the whole
       expression is <em>true</em>).
  <P>
  <LI> The post-increment or post-decrement operator (++ or --) can
       be used in expressions like <tt>y = x++;</tt> or
       <tt>if (x--) { ... }</tt>.
       In both examples, the value of variable <tt>x</tt> is changed
       (by adding or subtracting 1), but it is the original value of
       <tt>x</tt> that is used in the expression.
       So for example, if <tt>x</tt> is 2 before executing
       <tt>y = x++;</tt>, it will be 3 afterwards, but variable <tt>y</tt>
       will be 2.
       <P>
       Note that it is implementation-dependent exactly when the value of
       variable <tt>x</tt> is changed.
       For example, if we have <tt>y = x++ + x++;</tt>, and <tt>x</tt> is
       initially 2, then the value of <tt>x</tt> must be 4 after the
       statement executes, but <tt>y</tt> can be either 4 or 5.
       It will be 4 if the two increments of <tt>x</tt> are done
       after the value of the whole right-hand side is computed, and
       it will be 5 if the first increment of <tt>x</tt> is done
       after evaluating just one of the two operands of the plus.
       You can implement the ++ and -- operators either way.
</OL>
<a name="extra">
<h2>Extra-Credit Features</h2>
</a>
The following two aspects of double values are <b>not</b> required.
They are each worth 10 extra-credit points.
The extra credit is "all or nothing" for each feature;
i.e., there will be no partial credit for either feature.
<OL>
  <LI> Conversion from int to double in the following cases:
    <UL>
      <LI> assigning from an int to a double
      <LI> passing an int value to a function whose corresponding
           formal is a double
      <LI> returning an int value from a function whose return type
	   is double
      <LI> applying an arithmetic binary operator to one int value
           and one double value.
    </UL>
  <P><LI> Applying a relational or equality operator to two double
          values.
	  (The reason this is tricky is because there are no
	  op codes that implement these operations directly.)
</OL>
If you implement both feature 1 and feature 2, you must also
handle the case of applying a relational or equality
operator to one int and one double operand.
<b>Don't try to implement these features until you have the required
features implemented and tested.</b>

<a name="suggestions">
<h2>Suggestions for how to Work on this Assignment</h2>
</a>
I suggest the following steps:
<OL>
  <LI> Modify name analysis or type checking to ensure that a main
       function is declared.
  <P><LI> Modify name analysis so that the code generator can answer
       the following questions:
       <UL>
         <LI> Is an Id local or global?
	 <LI> If local, what is its offset in its function's AR?
	 <LI> For each function, how many bytes of storage are needed
	      for its params, and how many are needed for its locals?
       </UL>
  <P><LI> Implement code generation for each of the following features;
          be sure to test each feature as it is implemented!
    <UL><LI>function entry and exit
            (test with a single, empty function: <tt>void main() {} </tt>)
        <LI> int literals (just push the
	     value onto the stack) and WriteIntStmtNode
	<LI> double and string literals, WriteDblStmtNode and WriteStrStmtNode
	<LI> IdNode (code that pushes the value of the id onto the stack,
	     and code that pushes the address of the id onto the stack)
	     and assignments of the form <em>id=literal</em> and
	     <em>id=id</em>
	     (test by assigning then writing)
        <LI> expressions other than calls
	<LI> statements other than calls and returns
	<LI> call statements and expressions, return statements
	     (to implement a function call, you will need a third
	     code-generation method for the IdNode class: one that is
	     called only for a function name, and that generates
	     a jump-and-link instruction).
    </UL>
