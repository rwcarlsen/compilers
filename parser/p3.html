<a name="introduction">
<h2>Overview</h2>
</a>
For this assignment you will use the parser-generator <b>Java Cup</b>
to write a parser for the Little language.
The parser will find syntax errors, and for programs without errors,
it will build an abstract-syntax tree (AST) representation of the program.
You will also write methods to <b>unparse</b> the AST built by
your parser, and an input file (a Little program) to test your parser.
A main program,
<A HREF="P3.java"><tt>P3.java</tt></a>,
that calls the parser and then the unparser, is provided for you to use.
You will be graded on the correctness of your parser and your unparse methods,
and on how thoroughly your input file tests the parser.
In particular, you should write an input file that causes
the action associated with every grammar rule in your Java Cup
specification to be executed at least once.

Skeleton versions of the files you will need to write are in:
<tt>~cs536-1/public/html/PROG3</tt>
<P>
The files are:
<UL>
  <LI> <A HREF="Little.jlex"><tt>Little.jlex</tt></a>:
       A JLex specification for the Little language (a solution to program 2).
       Use this if there were problems with your JLex specification.
       (This file will be available after the final due date for
       program 2.)
  <LI> <A HREF="Little.cup"><tt>Little.cup</tt></a>:
       A Java Cup specification for a very small subset of the Little
       language (you will need to add to this file).
  <LI> <A HREF="Little.grammar"><tt>Little.grammar</tt></a>:
       A CFG for the Little language.  Use this to guide the enhancements
       you make to <tt>Little.cup</tt>.
  <LI> <A HREF="ast.java"><tt>ast.java</tt></a>:
       Contains class definitions for the AST structure that the parser
       will build (you will need to add unparsing code to this file, but
       you should <i>not</i> add any new classes, fields, or methods).
  <LI> <A HREF="P3.java"><tt>P3.java</tt></a>:
       The main program that calls the parser, then, for a successful
       parse, calls the unparser (no changes needed).
       To compile P3 then run it, using <tt>test.Little</tt> as the input,
       and sending the unparsed output to file <tt>test.out</tt>,
       type:
       <UL><tt>javac P3.java <br>
               java P3 test.Little test.out </tt></UL>
  <LI> <A HREF="Makefile"><tt>Makefile</tt></a>: A Makefile for
       program 3 (no changes needed).
  <LI> <A HREF="test.Little"><tt>test.Little</tt></a>:
       Input for the current version of the parser (you will need to
       change this file).
  <LI> <A HREF="Errors.java"><tt>Errors.java</tt></a>:
       Same as for program 2 (no changes needed).
</UL>

<a name="prec">
<h2>Operator Precedences and Associativities</h2>
</a>
The Little grammar in the file <tt>Little.grammar</tt> is ambiguous;
it does not uniquely define the precedences and associativities of
the arithmetic, relational, equality, and logical operators.
You will need to add appropriate precedence and associativity declarations
to your Java Cup specification.
<UL>
  <LI> Assignment is right associative.
  <P>
  <LI> The relational
       and equality operators (&lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, ==, and !=), are
       non-associative (i.e., expressions like <tt>a &lt; b &lt; c</tt>
       are not allowed and should cause a syntax error).
  <P>
  <LI> All of the other binary operators are left associative.
  <P>
  <LI> The unary minus, not (!), auto-increment (++) and auto-decrement
       (--) operators have the highest
       precedence, then multiplication and division,
       then addition and subtraction,
       then the relational and equality operators, then the logical
       <i>and</i> operator (&&), then the logical <i>or</i>
       operator (||), and finally the assignment operator (=).
</UL>
Note that the
same token (MINUS) is used for both the unary and binary
minus operator, and that they have difference precedences;
however, the Little grammar has been written so that the unary minus operator
has the correct (highest) precedence;
therefore, you can declare MINUS to have
the precedence appropriate for the binary minus operator.
<P>
Java Cup will print a message telling you how many <em>conflicts</em>
it found in your grammar.
If the number is not zero, it means that your grammar is still
ambiguous, and the parser is unlikely to work correctly.
<b>Do not ignore this!</b>
Go back and fix your specification so that your grammar is not ambiguous.

<a name="ast">
<h2>Building an Abstract-Syntax Tree</h2>
</a>

To make your parser build an abstract-syntax tree, you must add new
productions, declarations, and actions to <tt>Little.cup</tt>.
You will need to decide, for each nonterminal that you add, what
type its associated value should have.
Then you must add the appropriate nonterminal
declaration to the specification.
For most nonterminals, the value will either be some kind of tree node
(a subclass of <tt>ASTnode</tt>), or a <tt>LinkedList</tt>
of some kind of node
(use the information in <tt>ast.java</tt> to guide your decision).
Note that you cannot use parameterized types for the types of
nonterminals;
so if the translation of a nonterminal is a <tt>LinkedList</tt>
of some kind of node, you will have to declare its type as
just plain <tt>LinkedList</tt>.
<P>
You must also add actions to each new grammar production that you
add to <tt>Little.cup</tt>.
Make sure that each action ends by assigning an appropriate value to
<tt>RESULT</tt>.
Note that the parser will return a <tt>Symbol</tt> whose <tt>value</tt>
field contains the value assigned to <tt>RESULT</tt> in the production
for the root nonterminal (nonterminal <tt>program</tt>).

<a name="unparsing">
<h2>Unparsing</h2>
</a>

To test your parser, you must write the <samp>unparse</samp>
methods for the subclasses of <samp>ASTnode</samp> (in the file
<tt>ast.java</tt>).
When the <samp>unparse</samp> method of the root node of the program's
abstract-syntax tree is called, it should print a nicely formatted
version of the program (this is called <em>unparsing</em>
the abstract-syntax tree).
The output produced by calling <samp>unparse</samp> should be the
same as the input to the parser except that:
<ol>
  <li> There will be no comments in the output.
  <li> The output will be "pretty printed" (newlines and indentation
       will be used to make the program readable); and
  <li> Expressions will be fully parenthesized to reflect the order of
       evaluation.
</ol>
For example, if the input program includes:
<pre>
  <samp>if (b == -1) { x = 4+3*5-y; while (c) { y = y*2+x; } } else { x = 0; }</samp>
</pre>
the output of <samp>unparse</samp> should be something like the following:
<pre>
  if ((b == (-1))) {
      x = ((4 + (3 * 5)) - y);
      while (c) {
          y = ((y * 2) + x);
      }
  }
  else {
      x = 0;
  }
</pre>
<P>
To make grading easier, put open curly braces on the <em>same</em>
line as the preceding code, and put closing curly braces on a line with no
other code (as in the example above).
Put the first statement in the body of an <em>if</em> or <em>while</em>
on the line following the open curly brace.
Whitespace within a line is up to you (as long as it looks reasonable).
<P>
Note: Trying to unparse a tree will help you determine whether you have
built the tree correctly in the first place.
Besides looking at the output of your unparser, you should try
using it as the input to your parser;
if it doesn't parse, you've made a mistake either in how you built
your abstract-syntax tree, or in how you've written your unparser.
<P>
Another good way to test your code is to try compiling the output
of your unparser using the C compiler (gcc).
<P>
It is a good idea to work incrementally (see
<a href="#pairs">Suggestions for How to Work on this Assignment</a> below
for more detailed suggestions):
<UL>
  <LI> Add a few grammar productions to <samp>Little.cup</samp>.
  <LI> Write the corresponding <samp>unparse</samp> operations.
  <LI> Write a test program that uses the new language constructs.
  <LI> Create a parser (using <tt>make</tt>) and run it on your test program.
</UL>

<a name="astJava">
<h2>Modifying ast.java</h2>
</a>
We will test your program by using our unparse
methods on your abstract-syntax trees, and by using your unparse methods
on our abstract-syntax trees.
To make this work, you will need to:
<OL>
  <LI> Modify <tt>ast.java</tt> <b>only</b> by filling in
       the bodies of the unparse methods (and you must fill in all of the
       method bodies).
  <LI> Make sure that no <tt>LinkedList</tt> field is null (i.e., when
       you call the constructor of a class with a <tt>LinkedList</tt> argument,
       that argument should never be null).
       Note that it is OK to make the <tt>ExpNode</tt> field of a
       <tt>ReturnStmtNode</tt> null (when no value is returned),
       and ditto for the <tt>ExpListNode</tt> field of a
       <tt>CallExpNode</tt> (when the call has no arguments).
</OL>

<a name="testing">
<h2>Testing</h2>
</a>
Part of your task will be to write an input file called
<tt>test.Little</tt> that thoroughly tests your parser.
You should be sure to include code that corresponds to every grammar
rule in the file <tt>Little.grammar</tt>.
<P>
Note that since you are to provide only <em>one</em> input file,
<tt>test.Little</tt> should contain no syntax errors (you can also test your
parser on some bad inputs, but don't hand those in).
<p>
You will probably find it helpful to use comments
in <tt>test.Little</tt> to explain what aspects of the parser are
being tested, but your testing grade will depend only on how
thoroughly the file tests the parser.
<p>
So that you can be sure that the code in <tt>test.Little</tt> has no
syntax errors (without having to finish your own parser), all of
the <tt>.class</tt> files needed for a Little parser are available to
you in <a href="CLASS-FILES">~cs536-1/public/html/PROG3/CLASS-FILES</a>.
That parser doesn't create an actual AST, just one node with an unparse
method that only prints a message saying that it does not unparse.
To run P3 with the provided parser using your input file
<tt>test.Little</tt>, type:
<UL><tt>java P3 test.Little test.out</tt></UL>
(no output will be written to <tt>test.out</tt>).

<a name="pairs">
<h2>Suggestions for How to Work on this Assignment</h2>
</a>
<P>
This assignment involves three main tasks:
<OL>
  <LI> Writing the input file <tt>test.Little</tt> to test your implementation.
  <LI> Writing the parser specification (<tt>Little.cup</tt>).
  <LI> Writing the unparse methods for the AST nodes (in <tt>ast.java</tt>).
</OL>
If you work with a partner,
it is a good idea to share responsibility for all tasks
to ensure that both partners understand all aspects of the assignment.

<P>
I suggest that you proceed as follows (if you are working alone,
I still suggest that you follow the basic steps outlined below,
just do them all yourself).
<UL>
  <LI> Work together to write the input program <tt>test.Little</tt>.
       Use the grammar (<tt>Little.grammar</tt>) to add code to your
       test file that corresponds to each grammar production.
       Make small changes to <tt>test.Little</tt>, and
       after each change, run the provided parser to be sure you haven't
       introduced any syntax errors.
       You might want to save the intermediate versions of <tt>test.Little</tt>
       so that you can use them to test your own parser as you write it.
  <LI> Once <tt>test.Little</tt> is finished,
       work together on extending <tt>Little.cup</tt> and <tt>ast.java</tt>
       Start by making a very small change to <tt>Little.cup</tt>.
       For example, add the rules and actions for:
       <UL>
         <tt>type ::= DBL</tt><br>
         <tt>type ::= VOID</tt>
       </UL>
       Also update the appropriate <tt>unparse</tt> method in
       <tt>ast.java</tt>.
       Make sure that you can create and run the parser after making
       this small change.
       (To create the parser, just type <tt>make</tt> in the directory
       where you are working.)
  <LI> Next, add the rules needed to allow programs to include functions
       with no formal parameters and with empty statement lists only,
       and update the corresponding <tt>unparse</tt> methods.
  <LI> Still working together, add the rules (and <tt>unparse</tt> methods)
       for the simplest kind of expressions -- just plain identifiers.
  <LI> Now divide up the statement nonterminals into two parts, one part for
       each person.
  <LI> Each person should extend their own copy of <tt>Little.cup</tt>
       by adding rules for their half of the statements, and should extend
       their own copy of <tt>ast.java</tt> to define the unparse methods
       needed for those statements.
  <LI> Write test inputs for your statements and your partner's statements.
  <LI> After each person makes sure that their parser and unparser
       work on their own statements, combine the two by cutting and
       pasting one person's grammar rules into the other person's
       <tt>Little.cup</tt> (and similarly for <tt>ast.java</tt>).
  <LI> Now divide up the expression nonterminals into two parts, and
       implement those using a similar approach.
       Note that you will also need to give the operators the right
       precedences and associativities during this step (see
       <a href="#prec">above</a>).
  <LI> Divide up any remaining productions that need to be added,
       and add them.
  <LI> When working on your own, do <em>not</em> try to implement all of
       your nonterminals at once.  Instead, add one new rule at a time
       to the Java Cup specification, make the corresponding changes
       to the <tt>unparse</tt> methods in <tt>ast.java</tt>, and test
       your work by augmenting your <tt>test.Little</tt>, or by writing
       a new Little program that includes the new construct you added,
       and make sure that it is parsed and unparsed correctly.
</UL>
<P>
If you worked alone on the previous program and are now working with
a partner, see assignment 2 for more suggestions on how to work in pairs.
