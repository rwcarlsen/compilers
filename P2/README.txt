make targets:

  * The default make target builds my scanner.
  * The "clean" target removes all files generated by the default and "run"
    targets.
  * the "run" target runs my P2 tests on the Yylex.class
    file (assuming it resides in the same directory).

About my P2:

  My P2 does not rely on external input files for testing scanners.
  It directly passes strings into the scanner and does immediate in-code
  checks to see that the scanner's generated tokens are satisfactory.

  For your convenience, however, running P2 will also read an inTokens file and
  generate an inTokens.out file - this is done entirely independent of the tests
  that P2 runs. The P2 tests require the RobertTest.java file (included in
  my handin directory).

About Errors.txt:

  I found many candidates for questionable behavior in the provided
  (defective) scanner.  I tried to choose the most prominent 6 unique
  errors.  A couple other notable errors I found:

    * Bad doubles resulted in no error (e.g. "123.456.789")
    * tokens returned after unterminated comments
